# Super-Webscraper

Super Scraper is a web scraping app. It is scraping information from New York Times. It is displaying the Title, Summary and link within a card. You can save articles and click on the links to read the full article. There is also a link to New York times on the footer. 

This app is built with Node.JS, Handlebars, Mongoose/Mongo, and express.

Future features will include completing the note feature to allow the user to create notes for themselves. I will also work on a smoother functionality when saving the article.
